### Program's Uses and Importance

This is a program that outputs the top most talked about companies on the New York stock (or stonk) exchange using Reddit's [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) including information regarding the stock's
<ul>
  <li> name, </li>
  <li> abbreviation, </li>
  <li> price, </li>
  <li> change in the previous day (actual and precentage), </li>
  <li> previous close, and </li>
  <li> opening price. </li>
</ul>

Not only that, but the program can also take arguemnts regarding how many Reddit posts should be parsed through and how many companies should be shown.

This program can be used for personal gain or just to see what is in the public conscience at the time. The choice is yours.
