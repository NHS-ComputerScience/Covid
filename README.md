### Specifications and Installation

Most operating systems will work. All that is required is to having one of the latest version of Python, i.e., [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/), and [PRAW](https://pypi.org/project/praw/) installed. Python can be installed by manually downloading Python 3.9, homebrew, or some other equivalent. PRAW can simply be installed with `pip install praw` or `pip3 install praw` on CMD or terminal depending on your system.

Installation is fairly easy after that. Simply, download the .py file, change the directory to the src file, and run it in terminal with `python Main.py` or `python3 Main.py` depending on your system. Then it will proceed to run which you can give arguments regarding how many posts to parse thorugh and how many stocks to print out.
